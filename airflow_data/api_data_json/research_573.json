The new workspace was reasonably received as the project space with the Net Promoter Score of 14% and 78.6% agreed or strongly agreed that they could link the project to the class contents.", "prism:coverDate": "2017-02-10", "prism:aggregationType": "Conference Proceeding", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015170166", "dc:creator": {"author": [{"ce:given-name": "Ratchatin", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Ratchatin", "ce:initials": "R.", "ce:surname": "Chancharoen", "ce:indexed-name": "Chancharoen R."}, "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "R.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60028190", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028190"}, "ce:surname": "Chancharoen", "@auid": "36170214000", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36170214000", "ce:indexed-name": "Chancharoen R."}]}, "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015170166"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85015170166&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85015170166&origin=inward"}], "prism:isbn": "9781509055982", "source-id": "21100801151", "citedby-count": "4", "subtype": "cp", "dc:title": "A prototype project with a new workspace for Mechanics of Machinery", "openaccess": "0", "publishercopyright": "\u00a9 2016 IEEE.", "article-number": "7851795", "subtypeDescription": "Conference Paper", "prism:publicationName": "Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering, TALE 2016", "prism:pageRange": "202-209", "prism:endingPage": "209", "openaccessFlag": "false", "prism:doi": "10.1109/TALE.2016.7851795", "prism:startingPage": "202", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85015170166", "dc:publisher": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."}, "idxterms": {"mainterm": [{"$": "CDIO", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Customized parts", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Digital manufacturing", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Laser-cut", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Manufacturing methods", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Mechanical engineering students", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Student groups", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Video clips", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}]}, "language": {"@xml:lang": "eng"}, "authkeywords": {"author-keyword": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "3D Printer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "CDIO"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Laser Cut"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Video Clip"}]}, "subject-areas": {"subject-area": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Engineering (miscellaneous)", "@code": "2201", "@abbrev": "ENGI"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Communication", "@code": "3315", "@abbrev": "SOCI"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Education", "@code": "3304", "@abbrev": "SOCI"}]}, "authors": {"author": [{"ce:given-name": "Ratchatin", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Ratchatin", "ce:initials": "R.", "ce:surname": "Chancharoen", "ce:indexed-name": "Chancharoen R."}, "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "R.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60028190", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028190"}, "ce:surname": "Chancharoen", "@auid": "36170214000", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36170214000", "ce:indexed-name": "Chancharoen R."}, {"ce:given-name": "Kuntinee", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Kuntinee", "ce:initials": "K.", "ce:surname": "Maneeratana", "ce:indexed-name": "Maneeratana K."}, "@seq": "2", "ce:initials": "K.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60028190", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028190"}, "ce:surname": "Maneeratana", "@auid": "15042551300", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15042551300", "ce:indexed-name": "Maneeratana K."}]}}}
