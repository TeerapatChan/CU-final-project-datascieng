The technique is simply implemented by injecting water with very low ionic activity compared to formation water into an injection well. The injected water will increase reservoir pressure that is compulsory to drive oil moving toward production well. More than just maintaining reservoir pressure as obtained from conventional waterflooding, low salinity water creates shifting of surface condition, resulting in additional amount of liberated oil.

Disappearance of magnesium ion in the effluent is more obvious especially at 70 degrees Celsius and by low salinity waterflooding. This can be explained that at lower temperature, calcium ion disappears to form of calcium carboxylate complex with oil and at higher temperature, magnesium ion disappears as magnesium can start to form magnesium carboxylate complex with oil and hence, the amount of both calcium and magnesium ions is decreased compared to lower temperature. In dolomite reservoir, since both calcium ions and magnesium ions are provided from dissolution mechanism, the benefit from multi-component ion exchange will occur at high temperature as both calcium and magnesium ions will be consumed for oil recovery mechanism.", "citation-info": {"citation-type": {"@code": "cp"}, "citation-language": {"@language": "English", "@xml:lang": "eng"}, "abstract-language": {"@language": "English", "@xml:lang": "eng"}}, "source": {"website": {"ce:e-address": {"$": "http://www.iop.org/EJ/volume/1755-1315", "@type": "email"}}, "translated-sourcetitle": {"$": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "@xml:lang": "eng"}, "volisspag": {"voliss": {"@volume": "95", "@issue": "3"}}, "@type": "p", "additional-srcinfo": {"conferenceinfo": {"confpublication": {"procpartno": "3 of 6"}, "confevent": {"confname": "3rd World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences Symposium, WMESS 2017", "confsponsors": {"confsponsor": [{"$": "LAMA Energy Group"}, {"$": "LAMA Gas and Oil"}], "@complete": "n"}, "confnumber": "3", "confseriestitle": "World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences Symposium", "conflocation": {"venue": "Hotel Duo", "@country": "cze", "city": "Prague"}, "confcode": "133094", "confdate": {"enddate": {"@day": "15", "@year": "2017", "@month": "09"}, "startdate": {"@day": "11", "@year": "2017", "@month": "09"}}}}}, "sourcetitle": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "contributor-group": [{"contributor": {"ce:given-name": "Anna Maria", "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "A.M.", "ce:surname": "Ferrero", "@role": "edit", "ce:indexed-name": "Ferrero A.M."}}, {"affiliation": {"address-part": "Via Valperga Caluso 35", "@country": "ita", "city": "Torino", "organization": {"$": "University of Turin"}}}, {"contributor": {"ce:given-name": "Marian", "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "M.", "ce:surname": "Drusa", "@role": "edit", "ce:indexed-name": "Drusa M."}}, {"affiliation": {"address-part": "Univerzitna 8215/1", "@country": "svk", "city": "Zilina", "organization": {"$": "University of Zilina"}}}, {"contributor": {"ce:given-name": "Marian", "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "M.", "ce:surname": "Marschalko", "@role": "edit", "ce:indexed-name": "Marschalko M."}}, {"contributor": {"ce:given-name": "Isik", "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "I.", "ce:surname": "Yilmaz", "@role": "edit", "ce:indexed-name": "Yilmaz I."}}, {"contributor": {"ce:given-name": "Oznur", "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "O.", "ce:surname": "Karaca", "@role": "edit", "ce:indexed-name": "Karaca O."}}, {"affiliation": {"address-part": "Terzioglu Campus", "@country": "tur", "city": "Canakkale", "organization": {"$": "Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University"}}}, {"contributor": {"ce:given-name": "Ibolya", "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "I.", "ce:surname": "Torok", "@role": "edit", "ce:indexed-name": "Torok I."}}, {"affiliation": {"address-part": "Str.

Disappearance of magnesium ion in the effluent is more obvious especially at 70 degrees Celsius and by low salinity waterflooding. This can be explained that at lower temperature, calcium ion disappears to form of calcium carboxylate complex with oil and at higher temperature, magnesium ion disappears as magnesium can start to form magnesium carboxylate complex with oil and hence, the amount of both calcium and magnesium ions is decreased compared to lower temperature. In dolomite reservoir, since both calcium ions and magnesium ions are provided from dissolution mechanism, the benefit from multi-component ion exchange will occur at high temperature as both calcium and magnesium ions will be consumed for oil recovery mechanism.", "prism:coverDate": "2017-12-21", "prism:aggregationType": "Conference Proceeding", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040219312", "subtypeDescription": "Conference Paper", "dc:creator": {"author": [{"ce:given-name": "Falan", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Falan", "ce:initials": "F.", "ce:surname": "Srisuriyachai", "ce:indexed-name": "Srisuriyachai F."}, "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "F.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60028190", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028190"}, "ce:surname": "Srisuriyachai", "@auid": "35757997100", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35757997100", "ce:indexed-name": "Srisuriyachai F."}]}, "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040219312"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040219312&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040219312&origin=inward"}], "prism:publicationName": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "source-id": "19900195068", "citedby-count": "10", "prism:volume": "95", "subtype": "cp", "dc:title": "Evidence of Multi-Component Ion Exchange in Dolomite Formation during Low Salinity Waterflooding", "openaccess": "1", "openaccessFlag": "true", "prism:doi": "10.1088/1755-1315/95/3/032037", "prism:issn": "17551315 17551307", "publishercopyright": "\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.", "article-number": "032037", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85040219312", "dc:publisher": "Institute of Physics Publishinghelen.craven@iop.org"}, "idxterms": {"mainterm": [{"$": "Calcium and magnesiums", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Carboxylate complexes", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Complexometric titration", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Coreflood experiments", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Dissolution mechanism", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Oil recovery mechanisms", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Potential-determining ions", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}, {"$": "Wettability alteration", "@weight": "b", "@candidate": "n"}]}, "language": {"@xml:lang": "eng"}, "authkeywords": null, "subject-areas": {"subject-area": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Environmental Science (all)", "@code": "2300", "@abbrev": "ENVI"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "@code": "1900", "@abbrev": "EART"}]}, "authors": {"author": [{"ce:given-name": "Falan", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Falan", "ce:initials": "F.", "ce:surname": "Srisuriyachai", "ce:indexed-name": "Srisuriyachai F."}, "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "F.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60028190", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028190"}, "ce:surname": "Srisuriyachai", "@auid": "35757997100", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35757997100", "ce:indexed-name": "Srisuriyachai F."}, {"ce:given-name": "Suthida", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Suthida", "ce:initials": "S.", "ce:surname": "Meekangwal", "ce:indexed-name": "Meekangwal S."}, "@seq": "2", "ce:initials": "S.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60159954", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60159954"}, "ce:surname": "Meekangwal", "@auid": "57194650120", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194650120", "ce:indexed-name": "Meekangwal S."}]}}}
